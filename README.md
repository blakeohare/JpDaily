Just a hacky-ass little widget I threw together to help me study some N3
Japanese vocab and tech words.

I threw this together in a few minutes. Not meant for academic consideration.

The only technically interesting bit here is the randomizer for each set of
vocab is seeded based on the current date so that I that I can't overwhelm
myself by over-studying each day. I'm only allowed to see exactly the same 15
or so words per day per set.
