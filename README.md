Just a hacky-ass little widget I threw together to help me study some N3
Japanese vocab and tech words.

I threw this together in a few minutes. Not meant for academic consideration.

The only technically interesting bit here is the randomizer for each set of
vocab is seeded based on the current date so that I that I can't overwhelm
myself by over-studying each day. I'm only allowed to see exactly the same 15
or so words per day per set. This is done by using the `glibc` implementation
of random with a seed that's generated by a string that includes the current 
flash card set and the current year/month/day.

Basically:

```
seed = card set ID, year, month, day, dow
next = hash of multiplying each chard code by 37 and adding it to an acc
rnd:
  next = next * 1103515245 + 12345
  return next & 16 bit mask
```
